Type checking?
  collect constraints from code
  a chunk of code constrain generic types
  substitution(?) allowed when constraints are ok
  
Extensive hooking:
  function/method lookup
  operator lookups
  field lookup
  copy
  scope entry
  scope exit
  death
  
Patterns:
  - printf, typed
  - wrapped applicaton (vareadic)
  - stack allocation
